vIt's new script file (/static/moment/story/2_eng) now. The backgroud is set to change for better illustration. You can also keep the same backgroud pic when you start a new script file.
vWhy not take a look of "Achievement"? Just click "Achievement and Store". You may come back later.

vOh, you may see "No Record" in "Trip". So sad. Don't worry! Let's script to create some game record.

vNow take a further understanding of "Back" Button(on the bottom of the screen).
vWe can first create a character in this scale and create some trip achievements, chats. Then you may see those records are also deleted when the user clicks the "Back".
vNow we create the new character "Joey" first.
